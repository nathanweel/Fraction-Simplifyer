# Fraction Simplifyer
My first repository.

# !Important!
1. This program can only be accessed through the command line/prompt
2. Since this program was made 100% in Java, it will work on all platforms (but works best on Windows)

## How to Use
1. You must first get *all* code on your computer
2. Make sure you access the file first either through the command line/prompt or through activating a `.bat` file through the command line/prompt
3. Then just type `java Simplifyer` and your good to go!

## Credit
I got the base code for this program from a [***Stack Overflow***](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6618994/simplifying-fractions-in-java) post
